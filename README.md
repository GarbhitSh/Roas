The Roas project aims to revolutionize the operational efficiency of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) through an Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System. Currently, DTC faces challenges due to manual scheduling, inefficient route planning, and delayed emergency responses. Roas seeks to overcome these issues by introducing an automated system powered by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and real-time data analytics.

Proposed Solution
Roas offers a comprehensive solution with the following key features:

Automated Bus and Staff Scheduling: The system automatically allocates buses, drivers, and staff based on route requirements, driver comfort levels, and historical performance. It accounts for factors like rest periods and shift schedules to ensure operational efficiency.

Optimized Route Planning: Using machine learning algorithms, Roas identifies the shortest and least congested paths, factoring in real-time traffic data, road quality, and the number of substations. This optimizes travel times and enhances service reliability.

Emergency Response System: Roas automates the handling of emergencies, such as bus breakdowns, by instantly notifying relevant staff, such as mechanics, and rerouting resources as needed to minimize delays.

Dashboard for Managers: A web-based dashboard allows managers to monitor live bus locations, track driver and staff schedules, view emergency requests, and generate reports for operational analysis.

Driver and Staff App: This mobile app provides real-time updates on schedules, routes, and co-staff details, improving on-ground coordination and communication. It also offers an emergency window for reporting incidents like breakdowns.

Approach of the Project
Roas combines advanced technologies such as AI, ML, and GIS for route management and real-time decision-making. The system integrates with existing DTC infrastructure through APIs and middleware, ensuring seamless data flow. It employs scalable cloud-based architecture to handle large volumes of real-time data and user interactions, making it suitable for a fleet as large as DTCâ€™s.

Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution
Roas stands out by merging AI-driven predictive models with real-time data analytics, offering an unprecedented level of automation in public transport management. Its pathfinding algorithm (Raas) not only finds the shortest path but also factors in real-time conditions like traffic, road quality, and peak office hours, ensuring continuous route optimization. The ML model for driver and staff allocation ensures optimal resource management, enhancing both employee well-being and service reliability. This level of intelligent automation is unique to Roas.

How It Addresses the Problem

Automated Scheduling: Reduces human errors and inefficiencies in assigning buses, drivers, and staff.
Optimized Route Planning: ML algorithms choose the best routes based on traffic and road conditions, reducing congestion and travel time.
Emergency Response: The system automates responses to emergencies, improving both the speed and quality of resolutions, leading to fewer delays and greater safety for passengers.
In summary, Roas is a forward-thinking solution designed to address the operational challenges faced by DTC, offering scalability, reliability, and efficiency improvements that will benefit both DTC and the millions of commuters it serves.
